# KSB Log Generator

**KSB Log Generator** makes creating KSB logs easy. Simply select a week then provide a rough, natural-language account of your activities, and KSB Log Generator creates and saves a word doc ready to upload to Aptem.
- Saves doc with appropriate filename, including hours spent that week, date, and name.
- Uses OpenAI API to match KSBs and convert rough language to polished upload-ready account.
- Process multiple docs at once!
